# Description

"Admissions is getting their locate their counselor tool together which is feeding directly from Salesforce.  
Thad suggested I connect with you about potentially have Yann get this into Cascade and set up appropriately there.  
Currently, this page is pulling from Salesforce Production - https://static.stthomas.edu/undergraduate-admissions/events/locateCounselor.html 

It is also at the bottom of the webpage here - https://www.stthomas.edu/admissions/undergraduate/index.html -
which is different and pulling from Banner Data. We want to update and change this page.

## Updates

Goal would be to remove whatâ€™s current on the website (https://www.stthomas.edu/admissions/undergraduate/index.html)
and update with the new Locate your Counselor Tool pulling SF Data (https://static.stthomas.edu/undergraduate-admissions/events/locateCounselor.html)
where the Rest API is already setup.
